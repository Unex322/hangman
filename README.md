# Hangman is a classic game, popular all over the world, in which you have to guess a hidden word by spelling. 
# Immediately before the game you choose a topic on which the key word will be puzzled.
# Whether the word belongs to the chosen topic, the number of letters in the word as well as the letters to be discovered should all lead you to the correct answer.
# During the game, 6 wrong answers are possible. For each wrong answer (letter), a body part will be added to the man on the gallows. When it is completely drawn, you lose.
